# Final_Project_Perulero
For this Project, I ran the script on my local VM machine. I wasn't entirely sure how to link github and my local machine together but I did give a good effort. Within my project submissions you can see in one of my screenshots how I tried to link it but otherwise I wasn't sure how to add my link to the submission. Other than that, the project was relatively simple after messing around with the syntax for 40 minutes. I did need to correct my lines a few times but afterwards I ran the script just fine. More explanation on my difficulties can be found within my final discussion. Thank you Mr.Gilson for being an awesome teacher!
